Macros for FIJI in the FIJI Macro Language

This is an assortment of macros I have written to help automate processing of 5 dimensional (i.e. XYZ, time, & color) image data sets generated on various microscopes. They are typically limited to a small set of functions, defined more clearly in the code itself. 

The macros on tap today are:
 - SkimmR for PBNAS: Remove the first Z from a stack, max project, assign channel, repeat for the next color, merge, save as .tif
 
 And our special is a lovely Chilean Sea Bass.
